It몶s very hot.. An old man is asleep on the chair.

모모A fly comes and sits on the end of the man몶s nose.

모모The old man has a naughty monkey.

모모He chases the fly. The fly comes back again and sits on the old man몶s nose again.

모모The monkey chases it away again and again. This happens five or six times. The monkey is very angry.

모모He jumps up, runs to the garden and picks up a large stone.

모모When the fly sits on the old man몶s nose again, the monkey hits it hard with the stone. He kills the fly and breaks the old man몶s nose.
